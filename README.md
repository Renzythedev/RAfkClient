# RAfkClient 1.0

**RAfkClient** is an AFK Client that allows you to join Minecraft servers using **MCProtocollib**.
The base version is **1.20.1**, and it is designed to be flexible and extendable. I plan to introduce a plugin system and more features in the next version.

**Default Commands:**
- **help:** Displays all commands along with their descriptions.
- **name**
  - **get:** Displays the session name.
  - **set:** Sets the session name.
- **close:** Closes the client.
- **connect:** Connects to a specified hosted server.
- **disconnect:** Disconnects from the connected server.
- **send:** sends command or message to server.
